# Picchu
Coming soon - a UI framework from Microsoft.com

## Install

### With [Bower](http://bower.io/)

```bash
bower install picchu
```

### With [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)

First you must have installed [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/). Then install Grunt CLI as an admin user:

```bash
npm install -g grunt-cli
```

Then in the folder of the repository install the required npm packages:

```bash
cd picchu
npm install
```

Or just recompile the Sass files:

```bash
grunt
```

### Built-in server

You can launch a static server which watches for changed Sass files and automatically recompiles the changed files:

```bash
grunt server
```

With this server you can access the demo page at this URL: [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)
